/**
 * Annual fairs and events.
 *
 * The reason this is its own section rather than a page of listings: an
 * out-of-date event listing doesn't look broken. A stale date reads exactly
 * like a live one, so nobody goes back and checks it, and the reader finds out
 * at the gate.
 *
 * Two decisions keep this one honest, both inherited from recurrence.ts:
 *
 *   1. The RULE and the DATE are separate claims. "Third weekend in August" is
 *      something the organizer publishes; "15–17 August 2026" is arithmetic we
 *      did. A computed date says so on the page.
 *
 *   2. Confirmed dates for a specific year always beat the rule. When we have
 *      rung the organizer or read their own calendar, that is what shows.
 *
 * In practice almost every organizer announces dates a year at a time and
 * publishes no pattern at all, so most records here are `announced` plus a
 * confirmed year. That means the page goes quiet rather than wrong once the
 * year passes, and the call sheet grows an item instead of the site growing a
 * lie.
 *
 * The Arden Fair is the exception, and it's the one that shows why the two
 * claims are kept apart. The Arden Club states the rule itself — "Every year
 * the Arden Fair and Antiques Market is held on the Saturday of Labor Day
 * Weekend" — so this site can compute 2027 and 2028 and say out loud that it
 * computed them. The Ice Cream Festival sitting next to it can't, and says so.
