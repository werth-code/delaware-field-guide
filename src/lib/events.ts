/**
 * Annual fairs and events.
 *
 * The reason this is its own section rather than a page of listings: an events
 * page is the fastest-rotting thing on any local site. It is written once in
 * March, it is wrong by September, and nobody notices because a date in the
 * past still looks like content.
 *
 * Two decisions keep this one honest, both inherited from recurrence.ts:
 *
 *   1. The RULE and the DATE are separate claims. "Third weekend in August" is
 *      something the organiser publishes; "15–17 August 2026" is arithmetic we
 *      did. A computed date says so on the page.
 *
 *   2. Confirmed dates for a specific year always beat the rule. When we have
 *      rung the organiser or read their own calendar, that is what shows.
 *
 * In practice the research found something worth stating: of the events here,
 * NONE publishes a recurring rule. Every one announces dates a year at a time.
 * So most records are `announced` plus a confirmed year — which means the page
 * goes quiet rather than wrong once that year passes, and the call sheet grows
 * an item instead of the site growing a lie.
