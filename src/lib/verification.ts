/**
 * The verification gate.
 *
 * The convention is "a fact without both verifiedDate and verifiedSource does
 * not ship." That promise is worthless if it relies on remembering to keep it,
 * so it is enforced here rather than by discipline:
 *
 *   - No verifiedDate + verifiedSource  →  no verification stamp. Not possible.
 *   - No verifiedDate + verifiedSource  →  the page is `noindex`, and is
 *     dropped from sitemap.xml (see astro.config.mjs). An unfinished draft can
 *     never become the thing Google or an AI crawler cites.
 *   - Filling both fields in the JSON is the single switch that publishes it.
 *
 * Confirm the fact, fill in the two fields, done.

 * fact from another guide, and this is what enforces it. A dog park whose only
 * origin is a Google listing stays out of search until someone stands in it.

 * The distinction is shown to the reader, not hidden — "the city publishes
 * this" and "we called and asked" are different claims and the stamp says
